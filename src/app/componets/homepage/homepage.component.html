        Upload a document with text in it. This can be anything: a paper you're writing, an outline of a work in progress, an article you just downloaded, even a picture of a page of your textbook. (Don't worry, we won't store or share the text.) The tool analyzes
        the text within the document to find key topics and terms used, and then uses the ones it deems most important — the "prioritized terms" — to find similar content in JSTOR. Review the results and download any articles you're interested in. Adjust
        the results you're seeing by adding, removing or adjusting the importance of the prioritized terms.
